# CharSyn - Character Synergy Visualizer
A personal project for studying data anlysis. You can check characters in the database, vote on the best pairs for them, and the website will automatically tell you who's the best match based on votes from the community. Currently in progress.

## Tech Stack
1. Vanilla JavaScript
2. Python + Flask + Jinja Templates
3. [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for CSS

## Notable Features
1. Lazy loaded images for character profiles
2. Responsive UI for both Large and Small screen sizes
3. Sleek interface without any distractions
4. (In Progress) Data graphs showing most voted pairs for a quick and easy understanding of meta defining characters or most used units
5. Database focused design, meaning filters, columns and etc. only need to be changed in the database, the UI will adapt accordingly!
6. No usage of nodejs, meaning a simpler and lighter project.
